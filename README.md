## About the Project
How many of you remember those choose your own adventure books where you were young?  How exhilirating was it to make it 20 pages, further advancing the story?  And how frustrating was it to end up dead after a poor choice a couple of pages later?  This application will allow a user to relive those days as a youth, managing to escape a horrible situation.  While the choices for different stories will be expanded in the future, this application starts with a story of being trapped in a haunted mansion.  You, the user, must make all of the right choices to eventually escape this death trap!  Pick up valuable items along the way to aid in your journey!
